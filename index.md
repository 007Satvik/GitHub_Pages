## Passion
> Trying to be an engineer rather than a developer
knowing and coding in languages like`java`, `C/C++`, `python` does not make you an engineer. Many times you find yourself doing repetative tasks that many people have accomplished before. That is what separates a engineer from a developer. 
Recently my views are based on [this article](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/).
